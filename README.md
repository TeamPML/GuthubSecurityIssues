# GuthubSecurityIssues
For now, this is a set of scripts and intermediate results that would hopefully later result in the dataset of security issues from Github.


## [New] Brief Project Proposal

### Project Description

We are going to train an NLP model that would detect security requirements on github issues that have security labels.

### Data

We need to collect a new dataset with github issues, making sure there are issues with "security" label among them.

### Expectations of the Model

We expect the model to predict whether requirements (sentences in natural English that bear meaning of a software requirement) are concerned with sequrity.

Assumption:
security related issues bear information on requirements for the software
