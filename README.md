# GuthubSecurityIssues
The dataset of security and non-security issues from Github open source repositories. Classification model oof github issues, whether they concern security or not.


## Project Proposal

### Project Description

We are going to train an NLP model that would detect security requirements on github issues that have security labels.

### Data

We need to collect a new dataset with github issues, making sure there are issues with "security" label among them.

### Expectations of the Model

We expect the model to predict whether requirements (sentences in natural English that bear meaning of a software requirement) are concerned with sequrity.


----

If the model is used on requirements, we assume:
security related issues bear information on requirements for the software
