It seems to come down to the archive invalidation clearing out the cache when trying to forget (remove) the remembered dates that need to be reArchived. This appears to be an accidental regression based off the comment.\r\n\r\nI've removed the cache clearing from inside `forgetRememberedArchivedReportsToInvalidate` method. Both uses of this method will clear the general cache just after this method anyway.\r\n\r\nI can't think of any cases that this should cause a problem. The only think I can think is that doing it perhaps only moments later (after the loop) might increase the probability of clearing out something that was just cached. Even if it was the case but picking a time between the two seems arbitrary. In that case it would be preferable to clear the cache before the loop.\r\n\r\n### Review\r\n\r\n* [ ] [Functional review done](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#functional-review-done)\r\n* [ ] [Potential edge cases thought about](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#potential-edge-cases-thought-about) (behavior of the code with strange input, with strange internal state or possible interactions with other Matomo subsystems)\r\n* [ ] [Usability review done](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#usability-review-done) (is anything maybe unclear or think about anything that would cause people to reach out to support)\r\n* [ ] [Security review done](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/security-in-piwik#checklist)\r\n* [ ] [Wording review done](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#translations-wording-review-done)\r\n* [ ] [Code review done](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#code-review-done)\r\n* [ ] [Tests were added if useful/possible](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#tests-were-added-if-usefulpossible)\r\n* [ ] [Reviewed for breaking changes](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#reviewed-for-breaking-changes)\r\n* [ ] [Developer changelog updated if needed](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#developer-changelog-updated-if-needed)\r\n* [ ] [Documentation added if needed](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#documentation-added-if-needed)\r\n* [ ] Existing documentation updated if needed\r\n", "reactions": { "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/matomo-org/matomo/issues/18278/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0 }, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/matomo-org/matomo/issues/18278/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null }, { "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/matomo-org/matomo/issues/18277", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/matomo-org/matomo", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/matomo-org/matomo/issues/18277/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/matomo-org/matomo/issues/18277/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/matomo-org/matomo/issues/18277/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/matomo-org/matomo/pull/18277", "id": 1046661855, "node_id": "PR_kwDOABefqs4uMCf-", "number": 18277, "title": "Remove \"refer us\" feature", "user": { "login": "andyjdavis", "id": 354954, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM1NDk1NA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/354954?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/andyjdavis", "html_url": "https://github.com/andyjdavis", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andyjdavis/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andyjdavis/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andyjdavis/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andyjdavis/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andyjdavis/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andyjdavis/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andyjdavis/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andyjdavis/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andyjdavis/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false }, "labels": [ ], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [ ], "milestone": null, "comments": 7, "created_at": "2021-11-07T05:02:42Z", "updated_at": "2021-11-08T06:04:57Z", "closed_at": "2021-11-08T05:57:17Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": { "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/matomo-org/matomo/pulls/18277", "html_url": "https://github.com/matomo-org/matomo/pull/18277", "diff_url": "https://github.com/matomo-org/matomo/pull/18277.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/matomo-org/matomo/pull/18277.patch", "merged_at": null }, "body": "### Description:\r\n\r\nThis is a possible solution for https://github.com/matomo-org/matomo/issues/18232\r\n\r\nI have taken \"remove this feature\" to mean remove the code involved and not simply turn it off.\r\n\r\nRather than trying to revert the commits in the original PR I opted to go through the changes and remove what didn't appear to be required/useful.\r\n\r\nFirstly, I did it this way as there are changes made after the initial PR was merged like translations of the \"refer us\" popup's strings and possibly other changes.\r\n\r\nSecondly, some of the changes from the original PR may still be useful.

short summary of the issue in the *Title* above -->\r\n\r\nWhen I click on \"Pages\", I see a list of category names (i.e. group, wiki) and languages (DE, EN, FR). If I select a category name it goes on to show pages and their number of users (smartmap), but also include versions of the page with language names in the page name (smartmap?locale=de_CH). If I select a language it goes on to show all the pages with the language. I see the homepage therefore listed 3 times: homepage, homepage/de and DE - homepage. In order to figure out the total number of visitors for a specific page, I need to add all three numbers for all four languages. This is very confusing und subject to mistakes. On the other hand, if I want to know what percentage of my users are using the website in which language, I have very limited data. Most pages are listed in general. My suggestion is simple and would be very helpful - show the number of visitors per page (regardless of language). And if there was an additional feature, that showed for each page what number of visitors viewed the page in each language.\r\n\r\nWe use Matomo analytics for our website www.smartvote.ch\r\nWe use Matomo 3.6.0. and have no additional plugins.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"715\" alt=\"Screenshot 2021-11-02 at 09 56 23\"

To pass some send HTTP-related test.\r\n\r\nCurrently using Mariadb and tmpf memory setup to speed the process, but seems like failed some of the MySQL-related tests. some are being skipped, some are fixed. \r\n\r\nStill have quite a few screenshots that failed.

learn more about what features or services people are missing in Matomo so we can improve it further.\r\n\r\n## How we ask for feedback\r\n\r\nTherefore, we want to ask for feedback in the app like this:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2021-10-27 at 7 56 01 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/273120/139606488-97f72d88-ea79-4100-b418-1a1eaf579df0.png)\r\n\r\n* [x] Important to have the close button/icon visible clearly\r\n* [x] It should basically look exactly like on our cloud (the above initial screen has too much of a padding-top/bottom for example):\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/273120/139606537-67e04690-2eb4-4ef2-aeb2-5b93cd297639.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Questions to show\r\n\r\n* [ ] The first question is selected randomly out of our pool of questions\r\n* [x] We will rotate between below questions. Meaning next time it shows again, we show a different question. \r\n* [x] Once all questions are shown, we start again with the first question.\r\n\r\n### Questions\r\n\r\n* What are your biggest problems or pain points with Matomo and why?\r\n* What is the one thing you’d like to see improved in Matomo and why?\r\n* What is the feature you are missing the most in Matomo and why?\r\n* What is your main goal for using Matomo?\r\n* What is your main concern about Matomo?\r\n\r\n## When to show this\r\n\r\n* [x] When the message is supposed to show, we show it again on every subsequent page view until they either clicked on close, or clicked on the button in the bar\r\n commands data-understanding.ipynb drafts.json drafts.py ex.sh get_issues.py json2csv.py matomo17202.json matomo-org trial.ipynb [x] When someone closes it, we don’t show it for another 6 months. \r\n commands data-understanding.ipynb drafts.json drafts.py ex.sh get_issues.py json2csv.py matomo17202.json matomo-org trial.ipynb [ ] When someone clicks the feedback button, we don’t show it for another 6 months. \r\n commands data-understanding.ipynb drafts.json drafts.py ex.sh get_issues.py json2csv.py matomo17202.json matomo-org trial.ipynb (we could also change this to when user actually sent feedback in case they want to do it later)... or maybe if easy to do the popup could have a button \"remind me later\" and then we remind again in couple days -> let's maybe ignore it for now?\r\n* [ ] We only show it on desktop, not on mobile/tablet because it might take too much space and close button might be hard to see/reach etc.\r\n* [ ] We show it the first time 6 months after Matomo has been installed. This is important because we don't want to show it to all users at once to not get too much feedback at once, and because it means by then they have used Matomo for a while and know better what is possible and what is missing etc. \r\n commands data-understanding.ipynb drafts.json drafts.py ex.sh get_issues.py json2csv.py matomo17202.json matomo-org trial.ipynb [ ] Basically, on each day we show it to the people where it was installed 6 months ago. If someone installed it 7 months ago, then we don't want to show it. Otherwise if we rolled out this feature, then we would suddenly get feedback from all Matomo installations. Basically, we want to do something like `$daysSinceInstallation % 6 months == 0`. Problems: We don't have an install date I think, and what if they log in 6 months+3 days but not exactly 6 months ago to the day? We'd need to have some flexibility in there. Like we want to show it also to people that haven't logged in the last 1 week. If users only use it every few weeks that's fine then they might not see the popup. Likely they have little usage and requirements anyway. Maybe the next best thing is to check the first site creation date? (although when someone imports historical data then this may be changed). \r\n* [x] For now we only show it to super users, we might later expand to regular users depending on the amount of feedback we get\r\n\r\nAlso:\r\n* [ ] We won't show this when WhiteLabel is installed (I believe this plugin might disable Feedback plugin anyway)\r\n* [ ] To be defined: Maybe we also don't show it when there is any premium feature installed already?\r\n\r\n## On button click to get actual feedback\r\n\r\nWe show our feedback popup \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/273120/139607491-e3977b1d-e63f-4a97-8f93-cdb6bc8cf8b7.png)\r\n\r\n* [x] The title of the popup is the same question we were showing in the UI initially\r\n* [x] When it opens, the cursor should be already in the text field\r\n* [x] We require at least 10 characters to be entered\r\n* [x] We show a privacy policy with text eg `Your message and your email address will be sent to us by submitting this form. The information will be only used to improve our products and services. Your data will be processed by us, our hosting provider, and our support ticket provider. For more information have a look at Matomo's Privacy Policy.` Link for privacy policy: https://matomo.org/privacy-policy/ \r\n\r\n## Confirmation message \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/273120/139607590-cb6eec3c-f5b1-449e-8770-e1498d544423.png)\r\n\r\n* [x] People might expect a response and send support questions. The idea was to show a message that we might reply if we need more information, to lower expectations of a reply. Note: Maybe at some point could also show a message that if they submitted a support question, to ask it in our forum instead and if they reported a bug, to create a github issue. We could set up a dedicated page for this and say something like `If your message was not feedback, please [read here]` (to be improved). \r\n* [x] The feedback is sent to us by email similar to the other feedback\r\n* [x] The email includes the asked question, and the email of the user so we can follow up if needed\r\n\r\nAt a later stage we might ask a single select follow up question on the thank you confirmation message.", "reactions": { "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/matomo-org/matomo/issues/18251/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0,

Load html using ajax containing a `<select data-track-content data-content-name=\"name\" data-content-piece=\"piece\">`\r\n2. Put the loaded html inside an element using `Jquery.html()` method\r\n3. After load, there is no network activity to notify content tracking\r\n\r\nNote that if I put the select directly in my html it works as expected.

contact the Matomo community forum for questions: https://forum.matomo.org/ -->\r\n<!-- Important: If this bug is regarding a premium plugin you purchased on plugins.matomo.org, please email shop@innocraft.com instead of creating a bug report here. -->\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n<!-- When describing a bug, please tell us what should happen -->\r\n<!-- When suggesting a change/improvement, please tell us how it should work -->\r\nNo DNS Request for network entries just for hostnames in login_whitelist_ip/login_allowlist_ip\r\n\r\n## Current Behavior\r\n<!-- For bugs please tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior -->\r\n<!-- If suggesting a change/improvement, explain the difference from current behavior -->\r\nAll entries in login_whitelist_ip/login_allowlist_ip for networks that was specified with an \"/\" are attempted to be resolved using DNS. \r\nFor Example: \r\nWe have \"192.168.50.0/24\" in our login_whitelist_ip/login_allowlist_ip. Now our DNS Server recivies a ton of request (around 175000 per day) trying to resolve a IP for hostname \"192.168.50.0/24\" and \"192.168.50.0/24.ourdomain.com\"\r\n\r\nlogin_whitelist_ip/login_allowlist_ip still is working as expected.\r\nWe have this issue since our update to matomo 4.5.0\r\n\r\n## Possible Solution\r\n<!-- Not required, but if possible try to describe a fix or ideas -->\r\n<!-- how to implement the suggested change or improvement -->\r\nDon't try to resolve a DNS Name for a network.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce (for Bugs)\r\n<!-- For UI bugs, please try to reproduce that on our demo (https://demo.matomo.cloud/) -->\r\n<!-- if that is possible, please include the URLs and steps how to reprduce it there -->\r\n<!-- For other bugs or UI bugs that can't be reproduced on Demo, please include any relevant -->\r\n<!-- URLs or commands your are using that may help us to reproduce the bug -->\r\n1. Enter a \"/x\" Network into login_whitelist_ip or login_allowlist_ip like \"192.168.50.0/24\"\r\n2. Check all DNS Request send by Matomo\r\n\r\n## Context\r\n<!-- How has this issue affected you? What are you trying to accomplish? -->\r\n<!-- Providing context helps us come up with a solution that is most useful in the real world -->\r\n<!-- If there already was a discussion on our community forum about this topic, please also -->\r\n<!-- include the link here, as the posts might provide some helpful information -->\r\n\r\n\r\n## Your Environment\r\n\r\n<!-- Include as many relevant

`$minDatetimeArchiveProcessedUTC && Date::factory($tsArchived)->isEarlier($minDatetimeArchiveProcessedUTC)` and if I read this right, if the archive was created before the minimum date, then it doesn't force archive invalidation but probably it should.\r\n\r\nCould maybe someone have a look that this PR looks correct? Could think about adding a test but this might be tricky. I haven't even tried to reproduce the issue due to lack of time. I would think that\r\n\r\n* If browser archiving is enabled\r\n* And you view an older period\r\n* And you are viewing today\r\n* And there is already an archive that is older than the configured `[General]time_before_today_archive_considered_outdated` setting\r\n\r\nThen I would expect that maybe Matomo falsely isn't archiving again meaning effectively Matomo will only archive again if the report is being requested the next day again. But only max once per day maybe.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Review\r\n\r\n* [ ] [Functional review done](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#functional-review-done)\r\n* [ ] [Potential edge

evolution will now show the goal metrics when a row evolution is opened from \r\n- a report on a goals report page (specific or overview) \r\n- the ecommerce sales page\r\n- or any other report that has been switched to the goals visualization\r\n\r\nAdditionally it fixes this issues that existed before:\r\n\r\n- When a row evolution was opened from a goals report page the url parameter contained the `idGoal`, loading this URL again resulted in an error page, as the previously used javascript did not remove the `idGoal` before sending the request. See eg https://demo.matomo.cloud/index.php?module=CoreHome&action=index&idSite=1&period=day&date=yesterday#?idSite=1&period=day&date=yesterday&segment=&category=Goals_Goals&subcategory=4&popover=RowAction$3ARowEvolution$3AReferrers.getReferrerType$3A$257B$2522idGoal$2522$253A$25224$2522$257D$3A$40Websites\r\n\r\n- In a multi row evolution it is possible to choose the metric. Choosing the metric caused loosing any possible id parameters before, as the `extraParameters` were reset for this action. This caused a similar error as above, as an id param might be missing. This can be reproduced when e.g. switching the metric in a multi row evolution for forms: https://demo.matomo.cloud/index.php?module=CoreHome&action=index&idSite=1&period=day&date=yesterday#?idSite=1&period=day&date=yesterday&segment=&category=FormAnalytics_Forms&subcategory=7&popover=RowAction$3ARowEvolution$3AFormAnalytics.getPageUrls$3A$257B$2522action$2522$253A$2522getMultiRowEvolutionPopover$2522$252C$2522idForm$2522$253A$25227$2522$257D$3A$40divezone.net$252Fjobs$252Fapply$252Fchinese-speaking-ssi-instructor-or-padi-instructor$2C$40divezone.net$252Fjobs$252Fapply$252Fdivemaster-2\r\n\r\nfixes #3883\r\n\r\n### Review\r\n\r\n* [ ] [Functional review done](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#functional-review-done)\r\n* [ ] [Potential edge cases thought about](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#potential-edge-cases-thought-about) (behavior of the code with strange input, with strange internal state or possible interactions with other Matomo subsystems)\r\n* [ ] [Usability review done](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#usability-review-done) (is anything maybe unclear or think about anything that would cause people to reach out to support)\r\n* [ ] [Security review done](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/security-in-piwik#checklist)\r\n* [ ] [Wording review done](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#translations-wording-review-done)\r\n* [ ] [Code review done](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#code-review-done)\r\n* [ ] [Tests were added if useful/possible](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#tests-were-added-if-usefulpossible)\r\n* [ ] [Reviewed for breaking changes](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#reviewed-for-breaking-changes)\r\n* [ ] [Developer changelog updated if needed](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#developer-changelog-updated-if-needed)\r\n* [ ] [Documentation added if needed](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/pull-request-reviews#documentation-added-if-needed)\r\n* [ ] Existing documentation updated if needed\r\n", "reactions": { "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/matomo-org/matomo/issues/18228/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0 }, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/matomo-org/matomo/issues/18228/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null }, { "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/matomo-org/matomo/issues/18227", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/matomo-org/matomo", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/matomo-org/matomo/issues/18227/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/matomo-org/matomo/issues/18227/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/matomo-org/matomo/issues/18227/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/matomo-org/matomo/pull/18227", "id": 1037071564, "node_id": "PR_kwDOABefqs4tuV-O", "number": 18227, "title": "add build", "user": { "login": "peterhashair", "id": 3783072, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM3ODMwNzI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3783072?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/peterhashair", "html_url": "https://github.com/peterhashair", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/peterhashair/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/peterhashair/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/peterhashair/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/peterhashair/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/peterhashair/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/peterhashair/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/peterhashair/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/peterhashair/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/peterhashair/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false }, "labels": [ ], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [ ], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2021-10-27T07:29:31Z", "updated_at": "2021-10-27T07:34:39Z", "closed_at": "2021-10-27T07:34:39Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": true, "pull_request": { "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/matomo-org/matomo/pulls/18227", "html_url": "https://github.com/matomo-org/matomo/pull/18227", "diff_url": "https://github.com/matomo-org/matomo/pull/18227.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/matomo-org/matomo/pull/18227.patch", "merged_at": null }, "body": "add build\r\n\r\n### Description:\r\n\r\nPlease include a description of this change and which issue it fixes.

https://github.com/matomo-org/matomo/pull/18214.**\r\n\r\nThis PR is fairly complicated since the original notifications code added and removed DOM nodes itself, where this management is meant to be done (in most cases) by the framework.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n\r\n* Migrated notification angularjs directive to Vue (in Notification.vue).\r\n\r\n* Moved notification.js logic to new NotificationsStore class. This store houses a list of displayed notifications. Notifications are added to the store to display them, removed from the store to destroy them.\r\n\r\n* Created NotificationGroup component to display a list of notifications based on what's in the store. This approximates the `placeat` functionality except instead of directly adding DOM nodes to an element, we are adding notifications to the store which a NotificationGroup will see and display. The specific NotificationGroup that displays the notification is determined by a new `group` property in client side notifications.\r\n commands data-understanding.ipynb drafts.json drafts.py ex.sh get_issues.py json2csv.py matomo17202.json matomo-org trial.ipynb NotificationGroups are currently dynamically instantiated via NotificationsStore.show(). If we see that the placeat node is not initialized as the vue component, we do so. Then it pulls notifications from the store and displays them.\r\n commands data-understanding.ipynb drafts.json drafts.py ex.sh get_issues.py json2csv.py matomo17202.json matomo-org trial.ipynb This dynamic instantiation logic will eventually be removed once Vue is used everywhere (then the <NotificationGroup> component will just be used directly).\r\n\r\n* Added toast functionality to NotificationsStore (the previous implementation appears to be completely broken). \r\n\r\n* Implemented the scrollToNotification() functionality using an attribute we select for, since we no longer have the actual DOM node for a notification.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125140/141254445-d6775675-528d-444e-89eb-6eef916ec5a6.png)\r\n\r\n### Review\r\n\r\n* [ ]

Using the composition API (doing a lot of work in `setup()`) vs. the options API (properties in `defineComponent(...)`) moreso here since it's easier when watching multiple properties at the same time (though it's still hard to do w/ Vue). Neither API is preferred over the other by the vue apparently.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125140/138629386-0cd7b649-7d74-42ce-852d-b0cc71ef5f4f.png)\r\n\r\n###

matomo instance running behind a Reverse Proxy Server.\r\nWe don't manage the Reverse Proxy Server but we have received confirmation from the Administrator that the mapping is a standard mapping:\r\n- with a x.forwarded-host header activated (+other header are by default activated through the mapping environment)\r\n- page rewrite activated\r\nThe mapping is:\r\nhttps://OurReverseProxyServer/OurAppContextPath> --> http://OurMatomoServer:8080\r\nThe problem we have is the following:\r\nWe connect to matomo with the URL

we would like to solve this.\r\nThis behavior is the same with all the browsers.\r\nThe PRM administrator thinks the problem is at application level.\r\nWe suppose we need to specify the ContextPath

https://github.com/matomo-org/matomo/pull/18166.**\r\n\r\n**Note: I checked the comparisons UI tests locally and they passed, but I checked nothing else. So this PR is blocked until the CI issues are dealt with.**\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n* Turned the camelcase eslint rule off since response data does not include camelcase most of the time and it would get tiring to eslint-ignore that each time.\r\n* Convert comparisons service to comparisons store (see https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/state-management.html). Not implemented exactly as a store would be, but it works and interacts w/ angularjs code correctly.\r\n* Migrate comparisons component.\r\n* Fix URL encoding/angularjs issue in reporting menu described here: https://github.com/matomo-org/matomo/pull/18193/files#diff-94a861e734c0bb0ad8fdd4fa85389cb8303f90805917fbdd677f6c47c2b34810R132\r\n* Fix AjaxHelper.fetch requires some extra parameters to be sent for API requests (module=API&format=json).\r\n* Fix AjaxHelper.send, jqXHR objects do not follow the promise API exactly, so it's now wrapped in a native Promise.\r\n* Allow using `restrict: 'E'` in createAngularJsAdapter for use w/ migrating AngularJS components.\r\n* Create pattern for migrating $rootScope events (described below).\r\n* Create pattern for migrating $location usage (described below).\r\n* Convert comparisons service test file to typescript/vue. Includes the addition of https://github.com/nock/nock as a dependency.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125140/138544487-bfaa7d95-ab8e-47a3-9004-4f1658f72272.png)\r\n\r\n#### Migrating $rootScope events\r\n\r\nIn angularjs, $rootScope.$emit is used as a way to implement pub/sub throughout the frontend. We will of course not be able to use this mechanism with Vue, so I started replacing it here. \r\n\r\nInstead of $rootScope, we are just using `new CustomEvent` and `window.dispatch` directly (so we don't need to depend on another library). This functionality is exposed in the `Matomo` service, via `Matomo.on/Matomo.off/Matomo.postEvent`.\r\n\r\nDuring the migration, `$rootScope.$emit` is overridden to use Matomo.postEvent and Matomo.postEvent will use the old $rootScope.$emit. This way, $rootScope.$emit calls will trigger event handlers that still use $rootScope and handlers that use Matomo.on. As will Matomo.postEvent calls. Before Matomo 5 is released, this code will be removed.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, `$broadcast` will also call Matomo.postEvent, so Matomo.on can be used w/ events like `$locationChangeSuccess`.\r\n\r\n#### Migrating use of $location\r\n\r\n~AngularJS code that uses $location will be replaced with simply directly reading and writing `window.location.hash`. This is the simplest approach and allows us to keep our custom hash based routing.~\r\n\r\nThe above approach will not work until AngularJS is removed, because $location events, like $locationChangeSuccess, are triggered before changes to the hash/URL are made. So now, if comparisons listens to the hashchange, it will execute it's event handler AFTER others like the reporting page handler, which breaks comparison since the comparison will not be updated at that point. Currently, the ordering works because the comparison event handler to $locationChangeSuccess is added before the reporting page one, simply because the JS file is loaded afterwards.\r\n\r\nThis PR replaces that system by creating a store for parsed URL information in the MatomoUrl class, then using Vue computed properties to process it. The computed properties are used in Vue components, so when the URL is updated, the specific components that depend on that data automatically notice the change and update. This means event handler order is entirely irrelevant, and there is only one part of the code that parses the URL and one part of the code that uses $locationChangeSuccess. (This is, as I understand it, the accepted way to implement routing in modern state driven UIs (at least in React), where the URL is treated as a piece of application state with derived/computed state at various parts of the application).\r\n\r\nFor comparisons, this looks like this:\r\n\r\n1. on $locationChangeSuccess, MatomoUrl sets the search and hash of the URL to two `ref()` properties.\r\n2. there are a couple computed properties that use those two `ref()` values to compute a query parameter object (ie, `MatomoUrl.parsed.value.period`).\r\n3. there are computed properties in ComparisonStore that use the `MatomoUrl.parsed` property to parse segment/period comparison information & other information.\r\n4. the Comparisons.vue component consumes these computed properties and uses them in the template. The template registers with these computed properties, and re-renders the component (or parts of it), when one or more of the properties change.\r\n5. if the url changes, MatomoUrl will update the values of the two `ref()` properties mentioned above, and every computed property will automatically be aware of the change, and update.\r\n\r\nWhen angularjs is removed entirely, we can stop listening to $locationChangeSuccess in MatomoUrl, and use hashchange.\r\n\r\nExisting angularjs code can still use $location.\r\n\r\n### Review\r\n\r\n* [ ] [Functional review

system check was fine and updated every time with new release per automatic. So I dont checked system check again. Unfortunately, updates do not do a system check and report problems right after the update.\r\n\r\nToday I updated to newest version per automatic and saw by chance that the system check showed me errors for \"Required Private Directories\". That was new for me. This problem has however created an update or its a new check that not exists before. I found this tutorial to fix this issue: https://matomo.org/faq/troubleshooting/how-do-i-fix-the-error-private-directories-are-accessible/\r\n\r\nAfter set apache config \"AllowOverride None\" to \"AllowOverride All\" and execute `./console core:create-security-files` now I get banned from server each time I open matomo settings and there is automatic starting a system check.
