This would prevent the segment from continually needing to be archived past a certain date.\r\n\r\nThere will also likely be a lot of users that would still want access to these segments that were created for a certain time period or for a specific date range. So adding the option of being able to \"Disable\" the archiving for a specific segment could be very useful. There are likely many cases where people created a segment for a specific time period and kept the segments active in order to refer back to the reports in the future for whatever reason. Is such a case, Matomo would continue to try and archive the reports for the segment, taking up valuable time in the archiving process.\r\n\r\nFor the disabling of segments I think it would be useful to have it either as something that can be configured for a specific date or time period but also to be able to disable archiving for a segment whenever necessary in the UI without deleting the segment.\r\n\r\n", "reactions": { "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/matomo-org/matomo/issues/18682/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0 }, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/matomo-org/matomo/issues/18682/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null }, { "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/matomo-org/matomo/issues/18681", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/matomo-org/matomo", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/matomo-org/matomo/issues/18681/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/matomo-org/matomo/issues/18681/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/matomo-org/matomo/issues/18681/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/matomo-org/matomo/issues/18681", "id": 1113249686, "node_id": "I_kwDOABefqs5CWteW", "number": 18681, "title": "Add option for User Groups", "user": { "login": "Starker3", "id": 20905821, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjIwOTA1ODIx", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20905821?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Starker3", "html_url": "https://github.com/Starker3", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Starker3/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Starker3/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Starker3/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Starker3/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Starker3/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Starker3/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Starker3/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Starker3/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Starker3/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false }, "labels": [ { "id": 112370560, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWwxMTIzNzA1NjA=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/matomo-org/matomo/labels/Enhancement", "name": "Enhancement", "color": "bfd4f2", "default": false, "description": "For new feature suggestions that for example enhance Matomo's cabapilities.." } ], "state": "open", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [ ], "milestone": null, "comments": 2, "created_at": "2022-01-24T23:23:01Z", "updated_at": "2022-06-13T20:53:54Z", "closed_at": null, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "We have a request for a \"Users Group\" feature to be added to Matomo.\r\n\r\nThis can be useful for a number of different reasons:\r\n1. It allows easier permissions management for Matomo instances that have a large number of websites. The current permissions setup for Matomo requires the permissions to be set for a user for every individual website or to give a certain level of access to all websites at once. \r\nHaving an option to add a user to a group that has the permissions already defined can make this process a lot easier\r\n\r\n2. Groups could be used when creating a new segment to share the segment with a specific set of users. Currently the only option for Segments is the segment creator or all users. That means that when you have different groups that all have access to a site in Matomo that they need to search through all of the segments they have access to and look for the ones that are relevant to them. For example, you could have Marketing, Development, Customer Experience teams, etc. that would all be interested in different segments depending on their needs.\r\n\r\nI'm certain there are other benefits as well to having user groups.\r\n", "reactions": { "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/matomo-org/matomo/issues/18681/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray":

-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please provide a short summary of the issue in the *Title* above -->\r\nAccording to an [FAQ article](https://matomo.org/faq/troubleshooting/faq_171/) the `trusted_hosts` setting is a security measure against host injection attacks.\r\n\r\nI am using Matomo inside a Docker container behind an NGINX reverse proxy. According to [this FAQ](https://matomo.org/faq/how-to-install/faq_98/) I configured the `X-Forwarded-Host` header in NGINX and the Matomo config.\r\n\r\nLet's assume my domain is `example.org` and the internal container name of Matomo is `matomo-app`. Then I would add `example.org` to the list of trusted hosts because that will be the correct domain in `X-Forwarded-Host`. But when I do that I won't be able to login and just see a warning that the host is unknown. If I confgure `matomo-app` as trusted host however, everything works smoothly.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please include the URL of the part of the documentation that should be fixed/improved -->\r\n<!-- and describe which part causes you problems or the errors that are included in it -->\r\n\r\nAs far as I understood host injection attacks, Matomo behind an NGINX reverse proxy is not vulnerable as long as the domain is not configured the `default_server` in NGINX. In this case the [Reverse Proxy FAQ](https://matomo.org/faq/how-to-install/faq_98/) should be updated to explain, that the internal hostname of the backend server has to be added to `trusted_hosts` and that the reverse proxy is responsible for preventing host injection.\r\n\r\nMaybe the better solution would be to let Matomo evaluate the `X-Forwarded-Host` header if configured instead of the `Host` header to determine whether a host is trusted or not. Administrators who want to be more flexible in terms of different domains could still disable the host check.\r\n", "reactions": { "url":

truncating the row values after a certain amount of chars (55). If a string contained a multibyte character (umlauts, emojis, ...) around this position, it happened, that the multibyte sequence was disrupted.\r\n\r\nThis did cause any bigger issues on PHP 7, where only parts of the string were displayed in the PDF\r\nOn PHP 8 this produced an error, causing an abort of the PDF generation.\r\n\r\nSimply using `mb_substr` instead of `substr` fixes this issue for me.\r\n\r\nIf someone wants to reproduce:\r\n\r\n* Track any type of content (action, site search keyword, ...) with something like `öööööööööööööööööööööööööööööööööööööööööööööööööööööööööööö`\r\n* Create a PDF report that contains this content type\r\n* Click the download button to directly generate the report\r\n\r\n@tsteur I've targeted `next_release` as it's really a minimal, low-risk

This is helpful since it means components that use them don't have to manually initiate the fetch. However doing it this way can mean a lot of unneeded AJAX requests. The lazyInitSingleton function initializes a singleton upon first use so we only issue the AJAX requests when a store is used, without requiring components manually initialize them.\r\n\r\nThis is used in some of the sites manager PRs and some upcoming tag manager PRs.\r\n\r\n### Review\r\n\r\n* [ ] [Functional review

issue for a while, but wasn't able to with my normal setup. So I started to have some deeper thoughts about this issue. I excluded a possible browser bug, so it needed to be something within Matomo that let's the browser struggle with the session cookie.\r\n> \r\n> So I took a closer look at the requests that are sent by the Overlay. All requests that are sent to `index.php` are actually setting the session cookie. But there is one big difference those requests are having.\r\n> We have a special handling for the `samesite` cookie attribute implemented for all requests that are going to the Overlay module:\r\n> https://github.com/matomo-org/matomo/blob/9873cb71e66be0f80839c76e923c3b866dd23b46/core/Session.php#L166-L183\r\n> \r\n> The overlay page is sending multiple requests to the API. Such requests are actually setting the value to `lax`, while the requests going to the overlay module are setting the value to `none`.\r\n> \r\n> That wasn't a problem in my setup as the tracked url and matomo were both running on the same domain. So I set up another vhost to have different urls for matomo and the tracked site. Using this set up it was easy to reproduce the problem.\r\n> \r\n> So the problem actually is that depending on the request that last finished, before the `notifyParentIframe` request is sent, the samesite attribute is set to `lax` or `none`. With `none` everything works fine, but if the attribute is `lax` the iframe can't access the cookie, so it is not sent with the request, causing a new session to be started.\r\n\r\nThis fix actually checks if the referrer contains `module=Overlay` to set the `samesite=none` for those requests as well. This should properly work unless the referrer gets blocked for some reason.\r\nAn alternative would be to send some kind of magic parameter with all requests that are sent by the overlay, so we can check for that parameter.\r\n\r\nWhile testing that I also saw, that the Overlay was sending a request to `API.getPagesComparisonsDisabledFor`, which is not needed, so I added the Overlay module to the exclude list for that.\r\n\r\n@tsteur I have targeted the `next_release` branch as it might be nice to include that fix maybe. If you think it's to risky, feel free to change the milestone and I'll rebase the branch to `4.x-dev` instead.\r\n\r\nfixes #18538\r\nreplaces #18569\r\n\r\n### Review\r\n\r\n* [ ] [Functional review

periods on charts change (#18086), a check is performed on the currently selected period and date to determine if the period contains the current date. (eg. Period = 'week', Date = '2022-01-20'). This check is called by `jqplot.js` and executed by the periods service.\r\n\r\nThe A/B testing plugin for some internal reason needs to set the period to 'day' but the date to a range (eg. '2021-01-20,2021-01-27). This causes the `containsToday` check to fail as a valid date cannot be parsed from a date range.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a simple check before calling attempting to parse the date period, if the date is a range then the period type will be forced to type 'range' for the purposes of the `containsToday` check only.\r\n\r\nRef L3-205\r\n\r\n### Review\r\n\r\n* [ ] [Functional review

GroupedSetting (changed :plugin-name to :group-name and allow it to be optional)\r\n This component encapsulates the Vue side handling of the formField.condition parameter in angularjs, but in a way that doesn't require FormField to know about every other setting/setting value. It's used in measurable settings and tag manager parameters.\r\n* refactored condition handling to take place in GroupedSetting instead of FormField to reduce the amount of work FormField does and so we don't have to pass a dynamic function as a property to FormField and so FormField doesn't have to show/hide itself. BC w/ angularjs should still be maintained.\r\n\r\n@sgiehl @peterhashair it would be good to review this one before doing the sitesmanager PRs.\r\n\r\n### Review\r\n\r\n* [ ] [Functional review

This doesn't appear to be an issue w/ angularjs code due to the timing in when angularjs processes templates/materialize creates modal content. With vue, the HTML appears to show up quicker.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce, check out https://github.com/matomo-org/tag-manager/pull/404 and try to import a version. In the modal, you'll see \"Yes\"/\"No\" buttons which actually belong to the #confirmImportContainerVersion modal stored in the import version directive.\r\n\r\nFixed by checking for the number of .ui-confirm parents contained in the modal contents and skipping the button if it's more than 1.\r\n\r\n### Review\r\n\r\n* [ ] [Functional review

have a user report concerning slow performance for the deleteLogDataForDeletedSites scheduled task when more than one measurable has been deleted.\r\nOne of the queries that took really long to

matomo_log_visit log_visit ON log_form.idvisit = log_visit.idvisit WHERE log_visit.idsite in (15,11)\r\n```\r\nThis ran for over an hour and a half before they decided to kill it and instead run the following query for each ID site individually:\r\n```\r\nMariaDB [matomo]> DELETE log_form_field FROM matomo_log_form_field log_form_field LEFT JOIN matomo_log_form log_form ON log_form_field.idlogform = log_form.idlogform LEFT JOIN matomo_log_visit log_visit ON log_form.idvisit = log_visit.idvisit WHERE log_visit.idsite = 15;\r\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (4.264

individual site executed very quickly.\r\n\r\nThey tried again after this to manually execute the query that was previously running for both ID sites, after 10 minutes they killed that manual query again because it was clearly a lot slower than just doing it individually for each ID site.\r\n\r\n", "reactions": { "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/matomo-org/matomo/issues/18618/reactions",

provided in https://github.com/matomo-org/matomo/issues/18608#issuecomment-1011370361\r\n\r\nOn PHP 7.2 I actually get a\r\n```\r\nWARNING CustomDimensions[2022-01-13 15:00:37 UTC] [faa1f] /srv/matomo/core/Archive/Chunk.php(33): Warning - A non-numeric value encountered - Matomo 4.7.0-b2 - Please report this message in the Matomo forums: https://forum.matomo.org (please do a search

the issue.\r\n\r\nI took a deep dive through the code and the issue now appears to be clear to me.\r\n\r\nThe report generator uses the API Proxy to fetch API results. Therefor the parameters are determined using this method:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/matomo-org/matomo/blob/a01eea35273f7c569d060ec455ec0c0de07d1582/core/API/Proxy.php#L409-L441\r\n\r\nThe API definition for CustomDimensions is this one:\r\nhttps://github.com/matomo-org/matomo/blob/a01eea35273f7c569d060ec455ec0c0de07d1582/plugins/CustomDimensions/API.php#L54\r\n\r\nSo the default value for `$idSubtable` is actually `null`. In the request variables `idSubtable` is set to an empty string. \r\n\r\nThis causes the method to fetch the parameter value here:\r\nhttps://github.com/matomo-org/matomo/blob/a01eea35273f7c569d060ec455ec0c0de07d1582/core/API/Proxy.php#L422\r\nto throw an exception as the `$defaultValue` is `null`.\r\nSee \r\nhttps://github.com/matomo-org/matomo/blob/4f5cda954a6b64677f9b48223a91e0ec8785e055/core/Common.php#L507-L515\r\n*Note: `$requestArrayToUse[$varName]` is set to the empty string here*\r\n\r\nwhich then causes the value to be set to an empty string here:\r\nhttps://github.com/matomo-org/matomo/blob/a01eea35273f7c569d060ec455ec0c0de07d1582/core/API/Proxy.php#L426-L430\r\n\r\nThe `idSubtable` is then passed through various methods, finally causing the issue here:\r\nhttps://github.com/matomo-org/matomo/blob/115527353a9e75e01aa4d263408956ae45403bea/core/Archive/Chunk.php#L31-L33\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nRegarding the solution there are actually two ways to fix that. \r\nOne way is to simply handle an empty string for the `idSubtable` as `null`, like `false` is already handled.\r\n\r\nAnother fix would be to change the definition of the API method to `$idSubtable = false` instead of `null`.\r\nThe reason why that would work is, as this part\r\nhttps://github.com/matomo-org/matomo/blob/a01eea35273f7c569d060ec455ec0c0de07d1582/core/API/Proxy.php#L422\r\nwill no longer throw an exception. The `false` is a *valid* default value, which will simply be returned. And `false` is already handled correctly for `idSubtable` in the code.\r\n\r\nThis PR actually applies both adjustments. In all places I could find, we are currently using `$idSubtable = false`, so there is no good reason to use `null` in that one case. On the other side it can happen any time again, that someone defines `null` as default value again, which then could cause the same issue again.\r\n\r\nfixes #18608\r\n\r\n### Review\r\n\r\n* [ ]

this article https://matomo.org/faq/how-to/how-do-i-add-a-referral-exclusion-in-matomo/ does not really address the underlying issue - it merely recategorizes the referrer from “website” to “direct entry”, which in reality isn’t the true referrer for the user’s visit.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of what is happening.\r\n\r\n1. User clicks on an email link to visit the website.\r\n2. User browses website and adds items to basket (at this stage referrer is “Email campaign”)\r\n3. User completes the order but and website redirects to 3rd party payment provider (paypal/amazon etc)\r\n4. User returns to website (but now the referrer for the visit is reset from “Email campaign” to “website” or if you have set the referrer exclusions it will be set to “direct entry”. What we need is for it to remain as “Email Campaign”.\r\n\r\nAs a result we are over attributing the channel “direct entry” greatly (40% vs 15% on GA).\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if we actually should call this feature \"Referrer exclusion\" as it's more like an \"ignore refrerrer\" or \"keep the original referrer\"? We wouldn't exclude this tracking request. We would still track that referrer but re-use the original referrer from the same visit. If it's from a different visit then we would use again a direct visit?", "reactions": { "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/matomo-org/matomo/issues/18612/reactions", "total_count": 5, "+1": 5, "-1":

result in commands executed on windows `ps x` and `awk...` that not exist on windows.\r\n\r\nThere are even more commands, that are all suppressed with @shell_exec that do not throw a Matomo error, but still log errors on the windows apache, because commands are tried to execute, which apache then logs as errors without useful information.\r\n\r\nA general check for commands should be

call to `getNextId` fails for a temporary reason or where two archiving requests try to create a sequence simultaneously. \r\nIgnoring the duplicate entry error should be safe in that case, as it means the record already exists and the following `getNextId` should work as expected nevertheless.\r\n\r\n### Review\r\n\r\n* [ ] [Functional review
