"patch_url": "https://github.com/matomo-org/matomo/pull/17767.patch", "merged_at": null }, "body": "EDIT: broke the formatting by accident\r\n\r\n### Description:\r\n\r\nThis is a complete (for some definition of \"complete\") PoC of using Angular to replace AngularJS directives & components in Matomo, while still running alongside AngularJS. It can be used as a base to compare w/ the other PoCs that are coming and to see a possible Angular migration path.\r\n\r\n#### Current State\r\n\r\nThere are JS errors when using the selector and I didn't test everything (just the absolute minimum functionality):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Also a note re my knowledge of Angular: I'm somewhat familiar w/ the concepts and way of working in the framework, but I wouldn't call myself an expert. It's been several years since I worked with Angular last.)\r\nCore Concepts\r\n\r\n**Components vs MV-whatever**\r\n\r\nComponents in Angular encapsulate UI state and are primarily state driven. They are different from AngularJS directives, which are primarily mechanisms to manipulate the dom based on data. Components are designed (by me at least) by thinking about defining the state that's managed first (the list of sites displayed, the currently selected site, the search term), defining the input used to vary how the component behaves/looks, the output to allow outside elements to know when something in the component changes. Then filling out the implementation details.\r\n\r\nContrast w/ angularjs where it's more imperative. There's the input data, then the logic to render it and do things when data changes. Thinking about the interface and having hard boundaries between directives and the state they manage isn't considered. Nothing is there to prevent the creation of side effects in the input data.\r\n\r\n**Observables**\r\n\r\nObservables are a bit like promises, but instead of emitting one value to .then(), they can (potentially) emit any number of values. So they're a stream of data. They're useful in a UI context because they let you define a UI by thinking about how data flows through it.\r\n\r\nSome definitions:\r\n\r\n* observable: a stream that can be observed. we can listen to and act on the data that comes through.\r\n observer: something we can send values to.\r\n subject: both an observable and an observer. we can emit values to a stream, and act on the values we send. we do both in different places in the code, which is what makes this useful.\r\n\r\n For example:\r\n\r\n commands data-understanding.ipynb drafts.json drafts.py ex.sh get_issues.py json2csv.py matomo17202.json matomo-org trial.ipynb we create a subject for the list of sites to display\r\n commands data-understanding.ipynb drafts.json drafts.py ex.sh get_issues.py json2csv.py matomo17202.json matomo-org trial.ipynb we define our ui based on the sites subject (transforming the value of the subject, the list of sites, to whatever we want, storing the transformations in other observables)\r\n commands data-understanding.ipynb drafts.json drafts.py ex.sh get_issues.py json2csv.py matomo17202.json matomo-org trial.ipynb then subscribe to these observables in our template, so the template automatically updates when they change.\r\n commands data-understanding.ipynb drafts.json drafts.py ex.sh get_issues.py json2csv.py matomo17202.json matomo-org trial.ipynb and when the user types into the input, we query for new sites, then emit the value in the subject. this automatically passes through the transformations and automatically updates the template.\r\n\r\nIn this workflow, change detection (determining when a property changes, figuring out what needs to be re-rendered and then re-rendering) isn't used. As in, we never need to use $watch, $apply, $timeout or even think about those things. (That's not to say change detection is not used at all, templates are still re-rendered when @input() values for example change, but we don't just $watch an expression, check it over and over in the digest cycle and re-render things when it changes).\r\n\r\nThere is a learning curve for observables, and you don't have to use them to use Angular. It's definitely possible to just do things imperatively.\r\n\r\nAnd a quick note: we can't get an observable for @Input values. This was a requested feature when I last used Angular several years ago, and is still an open issue in Angular. But it's easy to workaround if needed (as done in this PoC).\r\n\r\n#### Modularization\r\n\r\nAngular is a modern framework library, so it is expected it will be compiled and built. Getting around this is harder than figuring out a way to work w/ it (in my experience).\r\n\r\nThis poses a challenge for the way Matomo achieves modularization since we can't just include some JS files that use Angular directly to work like we do with AngularJS. Well, we probably could but it would be a lot slower. We also can't use TypeScript making the code far more verbose.\r\n\r\nIn the PoC, every plugin can have it's own angular library in the angular subfolder. The library is compiled via a command and we load the .umd.js file. (NOTE: this can be automated so users don't have to use the getJavaScriptFiles event). When a plugin is deactivated, the angular library will no longer be loaded.\r\n\r\nThere are two commands to facilitate this:\r\n\r\n commands data-understanding.ipynb drafts.json drafts.py ex.sh get_issues.py json2csv.py matomo17202.json matomo-org trial.ipynb coreangular:generate-angular-module: this generates a blank library with an example component in a plugin folder library.\r\n commands data-understanding.ipynb drafts.json drafts.py ex.sh get_issues.py json2csv.py matomo17202.json matomo-org trial.ipynb coreangular:ng-build: this compiles a plugin library.\r\n\r\nNOTE: it is required to use this commands, using ng (the Angular CLI tool) directly will not work. The library it generates will not go into a plugin directory, it will go elsewhere, and it will be incorrectly generated. There appears to be a bug somewhere since Angular will not recognize some of the generated library files because the entrypoint is in a sibling subfolder and not in the parent folder of the actual library files. This is why the libraries don't have a public_api.ts file which is generated with ng generate library.\r\n\r\nAnd ng build depends on a root angular.json file that holds a manifest of every library in the plugin. But the number of angular projects depends on the plugins that have them. So the file needs to be generated dynamically before ng build is used.\r\n\r\nSidenote: we can also write a watch command to make development a bit easier.\r\n\r\n#### Migration Path\r\n\r\nAfter the bugs in this PR are fixed, Matomo could be converted to Angular one component at a time.\r\n\r\nModels and services can be converted when a component uses them. We can delete them only if they are not shared among other angularjs code. If we keep converting they will eventually all be removed since the dependent code will slowly decrease to zero.\r\n\r\nTwig templates should also be replaced. Instead, we output pages w/ an Angular component to encapsulate the UI. This'll make it easier to get rid of the AngularJS directives, since we'll be able to use the Angular version in more places.\r\n\r\n**Maintaining backwards compatibility**\r\n\r\nAngular does not allow using attribute directives when downgrading components (they expected everyone to switch to AngularJS components I'm guessing). But we can still provide backwards compatibility by creating a thin wrapper around a component (an example in this PR).\r\n\r\nThis also makes it possible to provide two way binding in AngularJS to avoid breaking things, without using it in Angular (which somewhat defeats the purpose of using Angular). We can listen to events in the adapter and set values we bind to the adapter.\r\n\r\nBefore releasing Matomo 5, we can get rid of all the adapters, downgrades and get rid of AngularJS completely.\r\n\r\n#### Migration Phases\r\n\r\n* Phase 1 - convert all angular directives and related code to Angular. Each converted directive/component should have an associated adapter that keeps existing code backwards compatible. This should be done in all plugins as well. When a higher level component that uses other components is converted, we'd change the use of the dependent components to Angular, slowly removing angularjs code.\r\n\r\n* Phase 2 - convert all twig templates that use angular into Angular components and just render the new component in twig. Ideally, we'd only use twig to generate the containing HTML.\r\n\r\n* Phase 3- remove shared angularjs files and with the Matomo 5 release, remove all angularjs code + downgraded adapters.\r\n\r\n#### Other implementation details/challenges\r\n\r\n commands data-understanding.ipynb drafts.json drafts.py ex.sh get_issues.py json2csv.py matomo17202.json matomo-org trial.ipynb Script loading order: Angular expects its scripts to be loaded after the page is rendered, and we need all our angular modules loaded before we bootstrap the angularjs app. But we have inline scripts everywhere that expect jquery to be available, angular to be available, and the piwik angularjs app to be bootstrapped (since we immediately try to access the angularjs injector in some places). We can't load the Angular files last, because then the code that uses the injector will fail. We can't do it first, because then we bootstrap the app too early.\r\n Worked around quickly in this PoC, by making every script, even inline ones defer and wrapping inline scripts in a DOMContentLoaded event. Seems to work\r\n\r\n commands data-understanding.ipynb drafts.json drafts.py ex.sh get_issues.py json2csv.py matomo17202.json matomo-org trial.ipynb Script loading order: Angular expects its scripts to be loaded after the page is rendered, and we need all our angular modules loaded before we bootstrap the angularjs app. But we have inline scripts everywhere that expect jquery to be available, angular to be available, and the piwik angularjs app to be bootstrapped (since we immediately try to access the angularjs injector in some places).

We can't do it first, because then we bootstrap the app too early.\r\n Worked around quickly in this PoC, by making every script, even inline ones defer and wrapping inline scripts in a DOMContentLoaded event. Seems to work.\r\n\r\n commands data-understanding.ipynb drafts.json drafts.py ex.sh get_issues.py json2csv.py matomo17202.json matomo-org trial.ipynb Transclusion from angularjs to a downgraded adapter, to an directive is possible via programmatically getting the transclude content and inserting it into an element in the child Angular component via jquery. Two examples exist in this PR. The only possible issue is there is a slight flash before the transclusion takes effect (it's possible this is only seen in a development build, but I didn't check this). The flash would go away when using the Angular components directly, so it would be a temporary change.\r\n\r\n### Pros & Cons\r\n\r\n commands data-understanding.ipynb drafts.json drafts.py ex.sh get_issues.py json2csv.py matomo17202.json matomo-org trial.ipynb Pros\r\n commands data-understanding.ipynb drafts.json drafts.py ex.sh get_issues.py json2csv.py matomo17202.json matomo-org trial.ipynb TypeScript, with easy to install and use polyfills. Makes development much faster.\r\n Will attract developers (who would see AngularJS and vanilla JS in 2021 and think \"I want to work on THAT project!\"?).\r\n The ng compiler tool seems stable and does not need much configuration. There was one issue described above, but it was fairly easy to workaround. It's definitely easier than using webpack directly.\r\n\r\n commands data-understanding.ipynb drafts.json drafts.py ex.sh get_issues.py json2csv.py matomo17202.json matomo-org trial.ipynb Cons\r\n\r\n commands data-understanding.ipynb drafts.json drafts.py ex.sh get_issues.py json2csv.py matomo17202.json matomo-org trial.ipynb JS errors can be hard to debug, especially w/ some of the dynamic things we do. Eg, I'm currently seeing an error when putting a downgraded component in a widget that is something like \"expected to be outside of angular but isn't!\" which has very little context.\r\n\r\n commands data-understanding.ipynb drafts.json drafts.py ex.sh get_issues.py json2csv.py matomo17202.json matomo-org trial.ipynb the downgrade functionality does not appear to be supported well. I suspect due to the amount of time since Angular was released. For example: there seems to be a bug, or just weird quirk in https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/cd2d82a91a5f547ae4c3d369f7f777245324c9e5/packages/upgrade/src/common/src/downgrade_component.ts#L94-L95. If you just downgrade components, w/o modules, everything will work. If you downgrade multiple modules and add them to an angularjs app, everything will also work. But if you only do it for ONE module, like say a single module in a proof of concept, downgraded components won't work, because the referenced code will not look for the correct Angular module to look for the component in. This is also an example of hard to debug errors. Though this might be a special case.\r\n\r\n commands data-understanding.ipynb drafts.json drafts.py ex.sh get_issues.py json2csv.py matomo17202.json matomo-org trial.ipynb Complexity of concepts involved (if using Observables for example).

linking to a different URL. That's because often the page is loaded async and it's unknown to the system when it's fully loaded. Therefore it is impossible to for example deep link to a specific system setting like https://mydomain/index.php?module=CoreAdminHome&action=generalSettings&editsiteid=5&period=day&date=yesterday&idSite=1#/HeatmapSessionRecording\r\n\r\nThis logic would make it work to make use of anchor links on the general settings page. There might be a generic solution to it but it's very tricky because the system can never really know whether it should/needs to wait for more requests to finish or whether some more might be coming etc. In many cases using again the `globalAjaxQueue` could work though instead as soon as there are 0 requests active after the load event then trigger this method. Such a solution may be quite tricky though as might then need to factor in whether user maybe already started scrolling etc. Could create a new issue to fix this properly maybe?\r\n\r\n###

core:archive log location (Or to use the default logs folder)\r\n\r\nSome more advanced options that can maybe also be set at the same time that the core:archive is being created (As a prompt perhaps) would be the time before the different reports (Day, week, month, year, range) are considered outdated with some defaults and recommendations for better performance.\r\n\r\n", "reactions": { "url":

valid.`\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20905821/123009988-dcddfb80-d411-11eb-880e-e07c22d70eed.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Possible Solution\r\n<!-- Not required, but if possible try to describe a fix or ideas -->\r\n<!-- how to implement the suggested change or improvement -->\r\nIt seems as though the Invalidate Reports UI is not correctly encoding the segment when invalidating the reports, running the command with the correct URL encoding: `./console core:invalidate-report-data --segment='actions%3E1' --dates=XXX` works to invalidate the reports from an SSH session. \r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce (for Bugs)\r\n<!-- For UI bugs, please try to reproduce that on our demo (https://demo.matomo.cloud/) -->\r\n<!-- if that is possible, please include the URLs and steps how to reprduce it there -->\r\n<!-- For other bugs or UI bugs that can't be reproduced on Demo, please include any relevant -->\r\n<!-- URLs or commands your are using that may help us to reproduce the bug -->\r\n1. Create a report with at least one condition as either greater than(>) or less than(<)\r\n2. Invalidate that segment in the Invalidate reports plugin in the Administration > System menu\r\n\r\n## Your Environment\r\n\r\n<!-- Include as many relevant details about the environment you experienced the bug in -->\r\n<!-- You can find some of that information in the system check -->\r\n* Matomo Version: 4.3.1\r\n", "reactions": { "url":

Overlay iframe by checking the HTTP referrer. If the referrer is from a specific Overlay controller action, then we know we're in Overlay.\r\n\r\nThe regex for parsing the segment parameter in this detection logic is incorrect. In it, we end up matching the segment parameter, plus everything after it. For example, in `&segment=&token_auth=...&force_api_session=1` we match `&token_auth=...&force_api_session=1`, and assume this is the segment.\r\n\r\nThis is passed on to the Overlay/client.js code which appends it to every API request it makes, assuming that it's the segment. These parameters passed in the URL breaks the force_api_session code, since in the browser we make POST requests (so the token_auth is not saved in the browser cache), and server side we do not allow force_api_session to be used in $_GET if using a POST request.\r\n\r\nFixing this in two ways:\r\n\r\n1. fixing the regex to not be greedy\r\n2. making sure token_auth/force_api_session are not appended to the URL even if present in the API request\r\n\r\n### Review\r\n\r\n* [ ] Functional review done\r\n* [ ] Potential edge cases thought about (behavior of the code with strange input, with

Other than the base exception class, the `getCode()` of PDO exception returns a string (like `HY000`). As the php exception class (and DbException, which directly extends php's Exception), requires the code to be an integer, we can't simply use the return value.\r\n\r\nfixes L3-109\r\n\r\n### Review\r\n\r\n* [ ] Functional review done\r\n* [ ] Potential edge cases thought about (behavior of the code with strange input, with strange internal state or possible interactions with other Matomo subsystems)\r\n* [ ] Usability review done (is anything maybe unclear or think about anything that would cause people to reach out to support)\r\n* [ ] Security review done [see checklist](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/security-in-piwik#checklist)\r\n* [ ] Code review done\r\n* [ ] Tests were added if useful/possible\r\n* [ ] Reviewed for breaking changes\r\n* [ ]
