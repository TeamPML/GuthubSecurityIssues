the code currently in getCoreJs out to chunks that are loaded in parallel, but it won't remove all of it.

During development of Matomo 5, however, it will be possible to disallow inline scripts that are not deferred, change existing scripts and make these two requests load asynchronously.\r\n\r\nThis one is trivial once the Vue migration is done.

Both of these issues will naturally be solved by the Vue migration, even if there's more code.\r\n- [web.dev](http://web.dev/) reports that much of the JS code is unused on first page load (4.5.0: 1.8/2.8mb, 4.8.0: 2.2/3.4 mb, 4.x-dev: 2.4/3.6mb). The unused amount goes up with Vue use, of course, due to the precompiled templates, but it seems that removing the templates by themselves (ie, loading the vue templates like angularjs html templates) won't be as effective as removing both JavaScript and templates (which will naturally occur w/ delayed import()).\r\n- Script execution time goes down even with more with JavaScript, likely due to Vue using precompiled templates, and maybe being just faster than angularjs.\r\n- The bulk of script execution time is spent with getCoreJs, nothing else. getNonCoreJs and the chunks (which now contain CoreHome/CorePluginsAdmin) all take <= 150ms to execute. Something in this script is very CPU intensive.\r\n\r\n## Conclusions\r\n\r\n**Overall, for the moment, performance is improving with the vue migration, despite more code. This is primarily due to precompiled templates and asset chunking working together.**\r\n\r\nHowever there appear to be some ways to further improve page load time:\r\n \r\n- Once the AngularJS code is removed entirely (in Matomo 5) and inline scripts w/o defer are disallowed, it will be possible to make getNonCoreJs/getCoreJs entirely asynchronous.\r\n- Implement optional on demand loading of plugin Vue modules (already done in a PoC PR).\r\n- Not as big an improvement as the rest, but styles can be moved to scoped styles and loaded on demand with lazy loaded plugins. This would reduce the size of the initial CSS request.\r\n- Avoid full page loads by handling all URL changes via the pushState API so loaded UMDs don't disappear when, eg, going to tag manager, going to dashboard, then going back to tag manager (do-able for Matomo 5 and can be done after Vue migration).\r\n\r\nI'll be creating linked issues for the above action items, excepting for the on-demand loading of plugins, which is already done in a PR.\r\n", "reactions": { "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/matomo-org/matomo/issues/18981/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0,

plugin's Vue module to be loaded on demand you'd have to:\r\n- override Plugin::shouldLoadUmdOnDemand() and return true\r\n- if the plugin defines angularjs adapters, move them all to a separate file manually included via the AssetManager event and set the component property to a reference like `{ plugin: 'MyPluginName', component: 'MyComponentName' }`.\r\n\r\nIf you need to use a plugin that's loaded like this in another plugin, you won't be able to import as you would normally. Instead you'll need to use the `importPluginUmd` method:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport { importPluginUmd } from 'CoreHome';\r\n\r\nimportPluginUmd('TagManager').then((module: typeof import('TagManager')) => {\r\n // ...\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: that adapters for stores or anything that gets added via angular(...).adapter will not be available, so making a plugin load on demand is a potential BC break. For TagManager this is acceptable since the old models weren't meant to be reused.\r\n\r\nTo see a plugin that uses this, see: https://github.com/matomo-org/tag-manager/pull/461\r\n\r\n###

When I run the system check, matomo requests the `global.ini.php` despite `enable_required_directories_diagnostic` is disabled. If I remember correctly, it worked when the option was first released in 4.6.0.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\nIf I disable `enable_required_directories_diagnostic`, matomo should not use HTTP requests to check whether `/config/global.ini.php` is (not) accessible.\r\n\r\n## Current Behavior\r\nI see two HTTP requests in the log leading to errors because `/config/global.ini.php` is not accessible (what's the goal), but this leads to the webhosting provider blocking my IP address after a few tries.\r\n\r\n```\r\n2022-03-18 11:17:51\tError 403 GET /config/global.ini.php HTTP/1.0\r\n2022-03-18 11:17:51\tError 403 GET /config/global.ini.php HTTP/1.0\r\n2022-03-18 11:17:51\tError \t AH01630: client denied by server configuration: /var/www/vhosts/example.com/subdomain.example.com/config/global.ini.php\r\n2022-03-18 11:17:51\tError \t AH01630: client denied by server configuration: /var/www/vhosts/example.com/subdomain.example.com/config/global.ini.php\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Possible Solution\r\nPrevent these requests if `enable_required_directories_diagnostic` is disabled just like it was before.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce (for Bugs)\r\n1. Disable `enable_required_directories_diagnostic` in `config.ini.php`\r\n2. Run the system check\r\n3. Look into the access log (of Apache) and find accesses to `/config/global.ini.php`\r\n\r\n## Context\r\nSome webhosting providers IP ban hosts if they request files/directories that are forbidden

Ideally, I would then be able to remove some of the recorded sessions to go below the quota, and the recordings would continue until the quota is hit again. At the very least, I would be able to start a new session recording while I have an unused quota.\r\n\r\n## Current Behavior\r\nI have Matomo Cloud with a limit of 150 recorded sessions. This limit was recently hit. I then went ahead and deleted some of the sessions via the HTTP API endpoint `HeatmapSessionRecording.deleteRecordedSession`. Upon doing so, the existing session recordings stayed \"Ended\" and didn't continue. I also wasn't able to create a new recording, but instead was presented with the following message:\r\n\r\n```\r\nLimit of recorded sessions reached\r\nThe limit for the number of recorded sessions is reached as you have currently 152 recorded sessions but your plan allows only up to 150 recorded sessions.\r\n\r\nTo use this feature, please ask a billing owner to upgrade your plan.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI currently have 43 recorded sessions in my account, after removing most of the 152 with the HTTP API. As the quota isn't updated and I can't restart the existing session recordings either, the only way to start recording again would (presumably) be to remove one of my existing session recordings. I didn't try that so far, as I want to keep the recorded sessions.\r\n\r\nI haven't tested whether the same problem arises when removing the recorded sessions via the GUI on the website. \r\n\r\n## Possible Solution\r\nThe quota should be kept in sync with the actual number of recorded sessions. If unused quota becomes available again, best case scenario would be that existing recordings continue until the quota is reached once more. A less optimal, but still viable, solution would be to at least be able to create a new recording when a portion of the quota is freed. \r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce (for Bugs)\r\n1. Start a session recording on Matomo Cloud\r\n2. Wait for your quota to be hit\r\n3. Delete some sessions via the HTTP API\r\n4. Try to create a new session recording\r\n\r\n## Context\r\nI am not always in a position to use a specific page that has a filtering capacity as an entry point for a recording. If I want to record all ecommerce interactions for visits that convert in a shop for example, starting on e.g. the cart page would be too late. So I have to start recording on the first page a user hits. That means I also get a lot of sessions which don't actually convert, and are therefore not interesting to me. \r\nTo get to the sessions which interest me, I then use the HTTP API endpoint `HeatmapSessionRecording.getRecordedSessions` combined with the `segment` parameter to identify the unwanted sessions. I then delete those sessions via `HeatmapSessionRecording.deleteRecordedSession`. If those deleted sessions get subtracted from the quota properly, I can keep recording until I have 150 useful sessions before I need to start deleting those. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Your Environment\r\n*

`trackPageView()` or similar call. VisitorId is now stored internally in the tracker to offset some of the impact of this, but in some cases where multiple trackers are being used there may be some functional differences as implied by the changes I've made to the tests where they only pass when `trackPageView()` is called before other tracker methods.\r\n\r\n### Review\r\n\r\n* [ ] [Functional review

more clear there is a search.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1127121/158078765-17ed0fa1-c986-4882-9104-3a1b01226db9.png)\r\n\r\n- [ ] In the search box make the categories bold to highlight them better and people better noticing the “help resources”\r\n\r\n![image

versions of help like Community help. And we could also mention a benefit around it like find what you are searching for quickly or discover new features by \r\nsearching or what not. Would need to come up with something\r\n\r\n![image (2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1127121/158078759-45927af8-371b-4e58-9027-4f761bc709ae.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add links to the

will never work due to how computed properties work in Vue. When a computed property is defined, it creates a ReactiveEffect instance that is attached to the current active \"effect scope\", if any. When that effect scope is destroyed, the reactive effect is removed, and changes no longer propagate through the computed properties.\r\n\r\nWhen a computed property is created in a global scope, outside of a component, there is no active effect scope. When created within a component, the component's effect scope is used. This means if the component is destroyed, for example because it is used in a `v-if`, the reactive effects to the global singleton store will be removed, and they won't get added again, since the singleton store will not be recreated.\r\n\r\nThis PR removes the method & its uses and reverts to the more verbose approach of manually initializing stores via AJAX requests in the components that use them (rather than doing that in the store's constructor).\r\n\r\n### Review\r\n\r\n* [ ] [Functional review

templates + piwik-manage-goals directive to Vue.\r\n* Add exception for target=_blank to DOMPurify configuration (only if rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" is present).\r\n* Allow model value for FieldCheckbox to be a number as well as boolean.\r\n* Remove use of `const` in piwikHelper.js as that should be vanilla JS.\r\n* Modify piwikHelper.compileVueEntryComponents so it can support multiple named slots.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n* There are several twig events that had to be respected during migration. BC is provided through two separate methods:\r\n - **vue-entry + named slots**: Using the Vue component directly (ManageGoals), and supplying named slots where the twig `postEvent` call is used. This is the simpler approach and works in cases where the twig template was not parameterized. It doesn't work when, eg, the event is called inside a twig for loop, as that can't be translated to a v-for loop in the frontend.\r\n - using {% set %} to save the result of a postEvent call in twig, passing this into the template, and referencing this as a dynamic component via `<component :is=...`. This allows us to iterate over data in the twig template, save the result and pass it to Vue for use. The `<component :is` usage is done specifically so the HTML is directly inserted. Using v-html would require a parent element which is not always acceptable (eg, when a postEvent() call is made between `<th>` or `<td>` elements.\r\n\r\nBoth approaches will be documented.\r\n\r\n###

Behavior\r\nOn XHR request to `https://my-domain/index.php?date=today&module=Live&action=getLastVisitsStart&segment=&idSite=1&period=day`, real time visitors list is refreshed and hovering visitor log icons display a tooltip.\r\n\r\n## Current Behavior\r\nIf mouse is hovering a visitor log icon when XHR request to `https://my-domain/index.php?date=today&module=Live&action=getLastVisitsStart&segment=&idSite=1&period=day` happens, real time visitors list get messed up, stop refreshing and hovering visitor log icons does not display a tooltip.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce (for Bugs)\r\n1. Mouse hover any visitor log icon except the `View Visitor Profile`\r\n2. Wait for XHR request to `https://my-domain/index.php?date=today&module=Live&action=getLastVisitsStart&segment=&idSite=1&period=day` to happens.\r\n3.

I explicitly redirect the PHP error logging to a file. I have additionally checked the logging of PHP errors on the CLI this way and it works. However, the archiving process does not write errors to the PHP log. \r\n\r\nIt does not always abort the same API requests. At a later time the segmet could be processed. \r\n\r\nWhat are my options for further error analysis?

after compileAngularComponents() is called, and use this to invoke GoalPageLink directive manually without angularjs. Ideally this workflow should be avoided but can't be as long as dataTables expect angularjs. For Matomo 5, when angularjs is removed, it might be possible to treat the twig template output as a vue template.\r\n\r\n### Review\r\n\r\n* [ ] [Functional review
